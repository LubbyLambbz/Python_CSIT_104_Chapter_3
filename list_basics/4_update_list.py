# Create a list named 'my_nums' with three numbers: 5, 12, and 20
my_nums = [5, 12, 20]

# Print the original list 'my_nums' to show its contents
print(my_nums)  # Output: [5, 12, 20]

# Update the second number in the list (at index 1) to -28
my_nums[1] = -28

# Print the updated list 'my_nums' to show the change
print(my_nums)  # Output: [5, -28, 20]
